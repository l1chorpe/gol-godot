# Conway's Game of Life in Godot

## Summary

Outside of the stupid pun on the name of the actress (who has absolutely nothing to do with this), it is a project I'm
making solely to get used to Godot's workflow and whatnot. As such, it is very likely to be abandonned after a short
while, which is partly why I'm using the Unlicense license. So feel free to steal anything.

However, as long as I update this project, I will update the changelog and comment my code as if it was something
serious. And hopefully, this doesn't become spaghetti code. If it does, I'll have called it.

## Changelog

### v0.1.0

- Base commit
- Added base functionality:  
    1. Add/delete cells in a grid
